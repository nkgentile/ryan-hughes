		"bio":[
			"My name is Ryan Hughes and I&rsquo;m a graduate student at UCLA. Although I&rsquo;d come to UCLA to pursue a PhD in French &amp; Francophone studies, I recently completed my masters and am now in the process of transferring my research interests (and considerable passion) into a career in architecture&ndash;starting with a masters in architecture.",
			"In working on French structuralism and post-structuralism over the past two years, it was only natural that my mind veered towards questions of politics, space, and architecture. Structure, measure, scale, nature, power&ndash;all of these concepts permeated my research. Given the opportunity to put these concepts into the praxis of architecture, I&rsquo;ve spent the past year at UCLA taking courses in the department of architecture and urban design.",
			"Combining my previous undergraduate background in computer science with the critical vocabulary I&rsquo;ve developed in a French department, this website is meant to serve as a portfolio, showcasing how these disciplines intersect with and ultimately inform my pursuit of architecture.",

				"header": "<i>&ldquo;Pyrite&rdquo; served as the midterm project for Erin Besler&rsquo;s Winter 2016 architecture studio, &ldquo;The Fit Out.&rdquo; The program was to create a 150,000 ft&sup2; office building in Irvine.</i>",
				"body":[
					"Conceptually, this project explores the intersections of orthographic projection, scale and form. The form of the overall structure is defined by the intersection of two cubes of equal size, one rotated 45 degrees from top, right, and front view. The result of this rotation creates a symmetrical structure in which the outline of the un-rotated cube is preserved in specific viewpoints. Because its symmetry is not perpendicular to the ground, in perspective the form appears to always have one surface slipping away from view. A grid of 400 5&rsquo; x 5&rsquo; windows is projected orthographically onto the residual square outlines that exist in elevation. This frame problematizes scale as the grid of warped windows intersect floor plates and appears to belong to a structure much larger than eight floors. More graphic than it is structural, an interior core supports the frame made out of a significantly lighter material like fiberglass or spandrel glass.",
					"To accommodate more than 160,000 ft&sup2; of leasable office space without warping the form’s symmetry, the interior is scaled to have a 50’ high, 10,000 ft&sup2; lobby proceeded by seven floors, 15’ high each. The structure is supported by three-foot thick steel beams along with four concrete cores that together include two fire stairs, four elevators, and eight bathrooms per floor. These key structural elements start at the base of the building and finish at the roof. Each floor is subsequently supported by a dense 10’x 10’ column grid of one-foot-thick beams aligned to the same grid as the core beams in an orientation that highlight the division of the floors between front and back. The density of the column grid resists a fit-out that relies on additional demising walls to divide interior space.",
					"The floor plans are certainly not typical plan as the floor plates shift with the tapered exterior, yet the cores remain in the center of each plan and provide starting points for separating the floors evenly between two or more tenants. No floors include demising walls so that each floor can be subdivided at the tenants&rsquo; request, providing an ample amount of freedom to customize the lofty interiors. The contrast between interior and exterior for the building is thus defined by the freeform, adaptable interiors with irregularly-arranged concrete cores juxtaposed with the highly ordered geometric exterior and complementary frame."

				"header": "<i>&ldquo;Marden&rdquo; served as the final project for Erin Besler&rsquo;s Winter 2016 architecture studio, &ldquo;The Fit Out.&rdquo; The program was to fit out part of the interior of another student&rsquo;s office building (in this case, a building designed by Lark Ruesch) for a particular tenant. I was responsible for the three half-sized floors showcased here, the tenant being a paper company requiring a structured, private-office plan for 200+ employees. The rest of the project was completed by a group of students: Colette Aro, Rayan Itani, Alicia Jones, Desiana Permata, Weslee Song, and myself.</i>",
				"body":[
					"Wanting to escape the monotony and stillness of Taylorism and the traditional private, structured office plan in a wholly rectilinear building, this project inverses that model to create an idiosyncratic, dynamic environment. In an age when 80 ft&sup2; spaces are more likely to constitute &ldquo;tiny homes,&rdquo; than offices, I took the position that large private office spaces hamper productivity and unhealthily pressure employees to spend their entire days within the enclosed space. Furthermore, when offices are carbon copies of each other with square footage aligned with job title, it effectively renders the employee anonymous &ndash; known only by rank and function if at all. The private office for our plan is thus reimagined as a work cubby whose claustrophobic space forces the worker to perform only the most individualized of tasks inside. Inner-office hierarchies are broken down as employees of different levels are grouped together and common areas (such as break rooms and meeting rooms) are combined on a common floor. The significantly larger spaces allotted to executive and managers are meant to emphasize the absurdity of the square-footage to worth-within-company equation. Regardless of job title, every individual employee is given a unique workspace; no two are alike.",
					"Formally, this project explores the intersection of three different organizing systems: grid, frame, and ergonomics. The grid of the rectilinear building is broken up by geometries borrowed and traced from paintings by Brice Marden. I quote his work specifically for its ability to fill out a frame (the frame here being the perimeter walls of the floor plans) with freeform curves. Cramped workspaces defined by Marden's curves are balanced with comfortable, so-called ergonomic furnishings from Knoll along with an abundance of potted plants. By imposing multiple organizing systems in a space already too small for the demands of the program, this project argues that the work of the architect is less and less over-determined design and rather the mediation of the multiple found, or rather borrowed, systems–and getting them all to <i>fit</i> within the fit-out."

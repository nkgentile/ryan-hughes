				"Conceptually&comma; this project explores the intersections of orthographic projection&comma; scale and form&period; The form of the overall structure is defined by the intersection of two cubes of equal size&comma; one rotated 45 degrees from top&comma; right&comma; and front view&period; The result of this rotation creates a symmetrical structure in which the outline of the un-rotated cube is preserved in specific viewpoints&period; Because its symmetry is not perpendicular to the ground&comma; in perspective the form appears to always have one surface slipping away from view&period; A grid of 400 5&rsquo; x 5&rsquo; windows is projected orthographically onto the residual square outlines that exist in elevation&period; This frame problematizes scale as the grid of warped windows intersect floor plates and appears to belong to a structure much larger than eight floors&period; More graphic than it is structural&comma; an interior core supports the frame made out of a significantly lighter material like fiberglass or spandrel glass&period;",
				"To accommodate 160&comma;000 square feet of leasable office space without warping the form&rsquo;s symmetry&comma; the interior is scaled to have a 50-foot-high&comma; 10&comma;000 square foot lobby proceeded by seven floors&comma; 15-foot high each&period; The structure is supported by three-foot thick steel beams along with four concrete cores that together include two fire stairs&comma; four elevators&comma; and eight bathrooms per floor&period; These key structural elements start at the base of the building and finish at the roof&period; Each floor is subsequently supported by a grid of one-foot-thick beams aligned to the same grid as the steel beams in an orientation that highlights the division of the floors between front and back&period; The floor plans are certainly not typical plan as the floor plates shift with the tapered exterior&comma; yet the cores remain in the center of each plan and provide starting points for separating the floors evenly between two or more tenants&period; No floors include demising walls so that each floor can be subdivided at the tenants&rsquo; request&comma; providing an ample amount of freedom to customize the lofty interiors&period; The contrast between interior and exterior for the building is thus defined by the freeform&comma; adaptable interiors with irregularly-arranged concrete cores juxtaposed with the highly ordered geometric exterior and complementary frame&period;"
